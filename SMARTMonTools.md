## SMARTMonTools

By Jack Szwergold

Then install SMARTMonTools via `aptitude` like this:

    sudo aptitude install smartmontools

### A simple check of SMART status from the command line.

Check the SMART status of `/dev/sda`:

    sudo smartctl -i /dev/sda

Output would be something like this; note this device doesn’t have SMART capability but the report format is similar for SMART capable devices:

	smartctl 5.41 2011-06-09 r3365 [x86_64-linux-3.13.0-63-generic] (local build)

	SMART support is: Unavailable - device lacks SMART capability.

### Enable the SMARTMonTools daemon (`smartd`) on startup.

First open up the `smartmontools` daemon config file:

    sudo nano /etc/default/smartmontools

And uncomment the line that reads `start_smartd=yes`:

	# uncomment to start smartd on system startup
	start_smartd=yes

### Adding a device to the `smartd.conf` file for monitoring.

First open up the `smartmontools` config file:

	sudo nano /etc/smartd.conf
	
And add some monitoring configs like this to the bottom; note only one is active and the other is commented out as an example:

	# 2015-09-24: Example config.
	#/dev/sda -a -d sat -I 194 -m email_address@example.com -M test -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
	# /dev/sda -a -d ata -I 194 -m email_address@example.com -M test -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
	/dev/sda1 -a -d ata -I 194 -m email_address@example.com -M test -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
	
### Adding to the `smartd.conf` file to Munin.

Create a symbolic link for the plugin to be active:

    sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/smart_ /etc/munin/plugins/smart_hda

Check the config:

    sudo nano /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node

Check to see if `[smart_*]` entry exists. If it doesn’t just add this simple config to bottom of the file:

	[smart_*]
	user root

### Sample contents from the `smartd.conf` for reference.

	# Sample configuration file for smartd.  See man smartd.conf.
	
	# Home page is: http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net
	
	# smartd will re-read the configuration file if it receives a HUP
	# signal
	
	# The file gives a list of devices to monitor using smartd, with one
	# device per line. Text after a hash (#) is ignored, and you may use
	# spaces and tabs for white space. You may use '\' to continue lines.
	
	# You can usually identify which hard disks are on your system by
	# looking in /proc/ide and in /proc/scsi.
	
	# The word DEVICESCAN will cause any remaining lines in this
	# configuration file to be ignored: it tells smartd to scan for all
	# ATA and SCSI devices.  DEVICESCAN may be followed by any of the
	# Directives listed below, which will be applied to all devices that
	# are found.  Most users should comment out DEVICESCAN and explicitly
	# list the devices that they wish to monitor.
	#DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m root -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner
	
	# Alternative setting to ignore temperature and power-on hours reports
	# in syslog.
	#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9
	
	# Alternative setting to report more useful raw temperature in syslog.
	#DEVICESCAN -R 194 -R 231 -I 9
	
	# Alternative setting to report raw temperature changes >= 5 Celsius
	# and min/max temperatures.
	#DEVICESCAN -I 194 -I 231 -I 9 -W 5
	
	# First (primary) ATA/IDE hard disk.  Monitor all attributes, enable
	# automatic online data collection, automatic Attribute autosave, and
	# start a short self-test every day between 2-3am, and a long self test
	# Saturdays between 3-4am.
	#/dev/hda -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././02|L/../../6/03)
	
	# Monitor SMART status, ATA Error Log, Self-test log, and track
	# changes in all attributes except for attribute 194
	#/dev/hdb -H -l error -l selftest -t -I 194
	
	# Monitor all attributes except normalized Temperature (usually 194),
	# but track Temperature changes >= 4 Celsius, report Temperatures
	# >= 45 Celsius and changes in Raw value of Reallocated_Sector_Ct (5).
	# Send mail on SMART failures or when Temperature is >= 55 Celsius.

	# An ATA disk may appear as a SCSI device to the OS. If a SCSI to
	# ATA Translation (SAT) layer is between the OS and the device then
	# this can be flagged with the '-d sat' option. This situation may
	# become common with SATA disks in SAS and FC environments.
	# /dev/sda -a -d sat
	
	# A very silent check.  Only report SMART health status if it fails
	# But send an email in this case

	# except for -C and -U, where ID = 0 turns them off.
	# All but -d, -m and -M Directives are only implemented for ATA devices
