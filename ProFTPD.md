## ProFTPD

By Jack Szwergold

First things first: Unless you are in 1993, there is no reason to use straight FTP anymore. Pretty much every “FTP” connection anyone uses nowadays is SFTP anyway. But on the off chance you have to work on a setup that requires FTP, you could do worse than use ProFTP to manage the service.

And if you restrict FTP access to a specific IP address, it will make the whole idea you are using flawed technology in a modern era easier to swallow; see the section on allowing FTP ports access for more details.

Install the basics for the build:

	sudo aptitude install libncurses5-dev libssl0.9.8

Install the Apache ProFTPD module: If asked how to install it, be sure to choose the “standalone” method:

    sudo aptitude install proftpd

### Squelch `mod_tls_memcache.c` warnings.

But wait! We’re not done with this yet. If you are using Ubuntu 12.04 you might see error warnings like this when the service starts or restarts:

	sandbox proftpd[8412]: mod_tls/2.4.3: compiled using OpenSSL version 'OpenSSL 1.0.0e 6 Sep 2011' headers, but linked to OpenSSL version 'OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012' library
	sandbox proftpd[8412]: mod_sftp/0.9.8: compiled using OpenSSL version 'OpenSSL 1.0.0e 6 Sep 2011' headers, but linked to OpenSSL version 'OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012' library
	sandbox proftpd[8412]: mod_tls_memcache/0.1: notice: unable to register 'memcache' SSL session cache: Memcache support not enabled

The OpenSSL header mismatch stuff is not much to worry about, and the `mod_tls_memcache` can be similarly ignored. But you can at least squealch that specific `mod_tls_memcache` message like this. Open up the `modules.conf` like this:

    sudo nano /etc/proftpd/modules.conf

Find the line that reads like this:

    LoadModule mod_tls_memcache.c

And comment it out like this:

    # LoadModule mod_tls_memcache.c

Now restart ProFTPD like this:

    sudo service proftpd restart

While those OpenSSL messages will still pop up, that `mod_tls_memcache` message should be gone.

### Allowing FTP ports network access.

If you are using a firewall such as IPTables, make sure it’s set to allow connections on port `21` as well as ports `50000` to `60000` for passive ports:

	-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
	-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 50000:60000 -j ACCEPT

While the above IPTables ruleset would open up FTP access to anyone who can reach your system, if you need to restrict FTP access to a specific IP address, do something like this:

	-A INPUT -s 123.456.789.0/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
	-A INPUT -s 123.456.789.0/32 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 50000:60000 -j ACCEPT

Remember: FTP protocol is highly insecure nowadays—to say the least—so restricting FTP access to one IP address is the best compromise if you need to use straight, insecure FTP for some reason.

### Sundry ProFTPD items on an Ubuntu/Debian system.

Get ProFTPD version number:

    proftpd -v

In this case the output should be something like this:

    ProFTPD Version 1.3.4a

Start, stop and control Apache on an Ubuntu/Debian system:

	sudo service proftpd start
	sudo service proftpd status
	sudo service proftpd force-start
	sudo service proftpd stop
	sudo service proftpd force-stop
	sudo service proftpd reload
	sudo service proftpd restart
	sudo service proftpd force-reload
	sudo service proftpd check-config

Open up the ProFTPD config for editing:

    sudo nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf

Follow the ProFTPD log:

	sudo tail -f -n 200 /var/log/proftpd/proftpd.log

### Setting up SFTP in ProFTPD

The location of the ProFTPD SFTP modules.

	/usr/lib/proftpd/mod_sftp_pam.so
	/usr/lib/proftpd/mod_sftp.so

An example ProFTPD SFTO configuration:

	<IfModule mod_sftp.c>
	
	  SFTPEngine on
	  SFTPLog /var/log/proftpd/sftp.log
	  TransferLog /var/log/proftpd/xferlog-sftp.log
	
	  # Configure the server to listen on the normal SSH2 port, port 22
	  Port 22
	
	  # Configure both the RSA and DSA host keys, using the same host key
	  # files that OpenSSH uses.
	  SFTPHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
	  SFTPHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
	
	  # Configure the file used for comparing authorized public keys of users.
	  SFTPAuthorizedUserKeys file:~/.sftp/authorized_keys
	
	  # Enable compression
	  SFTPCompression delayed
	
	  # Allow the same number of authentication attempts as OpenSSH.
	  #
	  # It is recommended that you explicitly configure MaxLoginAttempts
	  # for your SSH2/SFTP instance to be higher than the normal
	  #   MaxLoginAttempts value for FTP, as there are more ways to authenticate
	  # using SSH2.
	  MaxLoginAttempts 3
	
	</IfModule>

### ProFTPD: Config with tweaks.

This is an example config that would be placed in this file:

    sudo nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf

The whole file is reproduced below, but the specific items changed in this example are:

- `DefaultRoot`: Set to `/var/www/` instead of the “user jail” of `~`.
- `PassivePorts`: Set to range from `50000` to `60000` instead of `49152` to `65534`.
- `Umask`: Set to `002` and `002` instead of `022` and `022`.

And here is the actual, full ProFTPD config file for review:

	#
	# /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf -- This is a basic ProFTPD configuration file.
	# To really apply changes, reload proftpd after modifications, if
	# it runs in daemon mode. It is not required in inetd/xinetd mode.
