## Redis

By Jack Szwergold

### Sundry Redis items.

Redis should now be installed and you can check the version by running:

    redis-server --version

The version number should read like this:

	Redis server v=3.0.4 sha=00000000:0 malloc=jemalloc-3.6.0 bits=64 build=e10d4bb04434c274

You can check if it’s running by doing an `nmap` scan on port `6379` like this:

    nmap localhost -p6379

And the port should show as open like this:

	Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2015-09-22 20:48 EDT
	Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
	Host is up (0.00011s latency).
	PORT     STATE SERVICE
	6379/tcp open  unknown
	
	Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.06 seconds

You can “ping” Redis like this:

    redis-cli ping

The response should be:

    PONG

### Sundry Redis items on an Ubuntu/Debian system.

Start, stop and control Apache on an Ubuntu/Debian system:

    sudo service redis-server start
    sudo service redis-server stop
    sudo service redis-server restart
    sudo service redis-server force-reload
    sudo service redis-server status

### Benchmark Redis performance.

Run this command to benchmark Redis:

    redis-benchmark

The output should be something like this:

### Practical Redis data usage examples.

Now you can do simple tests via the Redis CLI like this:

    redis-cli

Set a value to a key like this; the response should be “OK”:

	redis 127.0.0.1:6379> set mykey somevalue
	OK

Get a value connected to a key like this; the response should be “somevalue”:

	redis 127.0.0.1:6379> get mykey
	"somevalue"
