## iPerf

By Jack Szwergold

### Basic iPerf usage.

iPerf is a network bandwidth testing tool that measures bandwidth between machines during a (default) 10 second test period. Results are reported in `Mbits/sec` but can be adjusted via the `-f` flag.

The first thing one needs to do to use iPerf is initiate an iPerf server on one machine using the `-s` flag like this:

	iperf -s

And on another client machine, initiate a client connection with the `-c` flag to the server setup in the first step; replace `[ip or hostname of server]` with the actual IP address or hostname of the server being connected to:

	iperf -c [ip or hostname of server]

This is a one way connection test between client and server so if there is a need to test speed in the other direction, the steps need to be swapped between machines; client becomes server and server becomes client.

### Bandwidth output options.

Bandwidth output options via the `-f` flag; default is `Mbits/sec`:

	'b' = bits/sec
	'k' = Kbits/sec
	'm' = Mbits/sec
	'B' = Bytes/sec
	'K' = KBytes/sec
	'M' = MBytes/sec

### Some advanced iPerf examples.

Start the server with port `65000`:

    iperf -s -p 65000

Client machine connects to the server (above) with port `65000`:

    iperf -c [ip or hostname of server] -p 65000

Set the interval to be 2 seconds between tests:

    iperf -c [ip or hostname of server] -i 2

Set the interval to be 2 seconds between tests and set the time in seconds to transmit 60 seconds (instead of the default 10 seconds)

    iperf -c [ip or hostname of server] -i 2 -t 60

Set the interval to be 2 seconds between tests and run it as a dual test to/from server:

    iperf -c [ip or hostname of server] -i 2 -d

Set the interval to be 2 seconds between tests, run it as a dual test to/from server and set the time in seconds to transmit 60 seconds (instead of the default 10 seconds):

    iperf -c [ip or hostname of server] -i 2 -d -t 60

	NAME
	       iperf - perform network throughput tests
	
	SYNOPSIS
	       iperf -s [ options ]
	
	       iperf -c server [ options ]
	
	       iperf -u -s [ options ]
	
	       iperf -u -c server [ options ]
	
	DESCRIPTION
	       iperf is a tool for performing network throughput measurements.  It can
	       test either TCP or UDP throughput.  To perform an iperf test  the  user
	       must establish both a server (to discard traffic) and a client (to gen-
	       erate traffic).
