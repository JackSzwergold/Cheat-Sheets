### Adding a user to a Subversion repository.

Adding a user to the Subversion basic authentication file:

    sudo htpasswd -md /etc/svn-auth-file [username]

### A simple Subversion usage example

The URL for an example repository:

    https://svn.example.com/repo/Some-Project/trunk/

Checkout the repository:

    svn co --username=userone https://svn.example.com/repo/Some-Project/trunk/ .

Go into the repository directory:

	cd Some-Project

Create a test file with `touch`:

	touch newfile.txt

Add that file to the repository:

	svn add newfile.txt

Commit `newfile.txt` and add a message/note about the commit:

    svn commit -m "Adding a file" newfile.txt

Remove a file from the Subversion repository:

    svn rm oldfile.txt

Move/rename a file from the Subversion repository:

    svn mv newfile.txt newfile-newname.txt

### Force all files into a Subversion repository.

Forces all files to be added:

	svn add --force *

Commit all files via `*` and add a message/note about the commit:

	svn commit -m "First commit for content edit purposes." *
