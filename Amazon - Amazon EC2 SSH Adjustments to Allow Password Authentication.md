## Amazon - Amazon EC2 SSH Adjustments to Allow Password Authentication

By Jack Szwergold

Open up the SSH daemon config like this:

    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find the line for `PasswordAuthentication` which will look like this:

    # Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
    PasswordAuthentication no

Change that `PasswordAuthentication` value to `yes` like this:

    # Change to no to disable tunnelled clear text passwords
    PasswordAuthentication yes

    sudo service ssh restart

And once you have another user setup with `sudo` rights, itâ€™s safe to get rid of that default `ubuntu` user:

    sudo deluser --remove-home ubuntu
