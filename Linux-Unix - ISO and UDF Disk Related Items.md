### Creating a volume based on an ISO.

#### Copy the ISO data to the new device.

9 times out of 10 a straight `dd` copy will work like this. If not, you need to repartition and prep the device.

***

Copying it is as simple as using this `dd` command:

	sudo dd if=~/ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

Or use the `pv` command with `dd` to monitor copy progress:

	sudo dd if=~/ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

When it’s done, output should be something like this:

	705536+0 records in
	705536+0 records out
	722468864 bytes (722 MB) copied, 32.6091 s, 22.2 MB/s

And if you check the info on `/dev/sdb` now using this command:

    sudo file -s /dev/sdb

The output would be something like this:

	/dev/sdb: # ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'Ubuntu-Server 12.04.5 LTS amd64 ' (bootable)

#### Prepping and partitioning the device for use.

The 1 time out of 10 a straight `dd` copy won’t work work, you need to repartition and prep the device as outlined below.

***

First, use `lsblk` to see a list of all connected block level devices:

    lsblk

In this case we’ll be acting on the device `/dev/sdb` so this will help you check exactly what `/dev/sdb` is:

    sudo file -s /dev/sdb

That output would be something like this:

    /dev/sdb: data

Knowing that the device is accessible and ready, we will partition the device like this:

	sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

Once in the `fdisk` interface, press `n` for a new partition. The output will be something like this:

	Partition type:
	   p   primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
	   e   extended

Select `p` for a `primary` partition. Select all of the defaults for the items like partition number, first sector and last sector.

When that is done hit `t` for the partition type. The new prompt would be:

    Hex code (type L to list codes):

If it asks you to select a partition to act on, remember the partition number from above and enter that; it should be `1`. Then select `6` for the `FAT16` partition type. The output should then be:

    Changed system type of partition 1 to 6 (FAT16)

With that done type `w` to write the partition info to the disk and the process of partitioning should be finished and you will see the following output:

	The partition table has been altered!
	
	Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
	
	WARNING: If you have created or modified any DOS 6.x
	partitions, please see the fdisk manual page for additional
	information.
	Syncing disks.

Don’t worry about the warning. You’re all done as far as partitioning goes.
	
### Manually mount an ISO image to a mount point.

Create a mount point:

	mkdir -p ~/ubuntu-12.04.5

Mount the ISO to the mount point:

	sudo mount -o ro,loop ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso ~/ubuntu-12.04.5

Unmount the ISO from the mount point like this:

	sudo umount ~/ubuntu-12.04.5

### Sundry UDF and similar items.

#### Getting the info on an ISO.

Get info on the ISO itself with a plain `file` check like this:

    file ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso

Output would be something like this:

	ubuntu-12.04.5-server-amd64.iso: # ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'Ubuntu-Server 12.04.5 LTS amd64 ' (bootable)

#### Creating UDF file systems from scratch.

Install `udftools` and `udisks` on your system if you need them:

	sudo aptitude install udftools udisks

Create a UDF file system on a partition:

    sudo mkudffs --media-type=hd --blocksize=512 /dev/sdb1
