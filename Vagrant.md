## Vagrant

By Jack Szwergold

### Basic usage.

This will init a basic Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit) setup:

    vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

The response to this command will be:

	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.

A full list of available boxes can be found here:

    https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search

Once that Vagrant box has been downloaded, run this command to start the instance:

    vagrant up

This variant of the command will give you debugging info:

    vagrant up --debug

And this variant of the command will rerun the provisioning scripts on an already established Vagrant box:

    vagrant up --provision

SSH into the Vagrant box with this command:

    vagrant ssh

Stop the Vagrant box like this:

    vagrant halt

If you want to stop the Vagrant box and get rid of the installed disk/config from VirtualBox, run this command:

    vagrant destroy

You can change the default path that Vagrant uses to save remove boxes by entering this in the Terminal or adding it to your `.bash_profile`:

    export VAGRANT_HOME="/path/to/save/VagrantBoxes"

And the default SSH password for the user `vagrant` is `vagrant`.

Get the status of all Vagrant instances connected to your logged in user running this command:

    vagrant global-status

The output should be something like this:

	id       name                provider   state    directory
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	0b55b6e  default             virtualbox poweroff /Users/jack/Vagrant-Scripts/Ubuntu1404
	689d9e7  vagrant             virtualbox running  /Users/jack/Vagrant-Scripts
	28ee4e8  sandbox             virtualbox poweroff /Users/jack/Vagrant-Scripts
	b467de6  Sandbox_UBUNTU_1404 virtualbox poweroff /Users/jack/Vagrant-Scripts
	
	The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
	on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
	up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
	that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
	with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
	"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"

Note that list is a mess since a lot of the the machines listed don’t exist anymore for various reasons. So to clean up the list, run this command to prune the list:

    vagrant global-status --prune

And the list should be trimmed down as follows:

	id       name                provider   state    directory
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	b467de6  Sandbox_UBUNTU_1404 virtualbox poweroff /Users/jack/Vagrant-Scripts
	
	The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
	on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
	up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
	that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
	with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
	"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"

To upgrade the already downloaded Vagrant boxes—so you don’t have to upgrade each boxes OS individually—just run this command:

    vagrant box --force update

And for some reason in Mac OS X, that command will choke in El Capitan (10.11) and Sierra (10.12) when running Vagrant 1.8.7. And the solution is to ditch the Vagrant specific version of Curl like this:

	sudo rm /opt/vagrant/embedded/bin/curl

As of Vagrant version 1.9 and above, to clear out old and outdated versions of Vagrant boxes—which are often not needed and take up space—just run this command:

	vagrant box prune

### Debugging Vagrant.

Check the SSH options for the Vagrant box:

    vagrant ssh-config

Output should be something like this:

	Host default
	  HostName 127.0.0.1
	  User vagrant
	  Port 2222
	  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
	  StrictHostKeyChecking no
	  PasswordAuthentication no
	  IdentityFile "/Users/jack/Vagrant_Ubuntu_1404/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key"
	  IdentitiesOnly yes
	  LogLevel FATAL

### Configuring Vagrant.

Okay, so with the basics done, you can edit the Vagrant config file (aka: `Vagrantfile`) to have a config like this:

	Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
	  config.vm.box_check_update = false
	  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.20"
	  config.vm.hostname = "vagrant"
	end

I removed all of the comments and just have a few of the core config options such as disabling the update checking and setting a private “host only” network to `192.168.56.20`.

### Upgrading Vagrant.

If you download Vagrant and it seemingly hangs forever on “Verifying Vagrant.pkg” window that is becuase of System Integrity Protection (SIP). To get around this, install—or upgrade Vagrant—from the command line like this:

    sudo installer -package /Volumes/Vagrant/Vagrant.pkg -target /

### Creating your own Vagrant box.

Building a Vagrant box:

#### Build a basic OS box.

Set it up like any VirtualBox setup with the default user set as `sysop`. Just make sure the second Ethernet adapter is a “Host Only” adapter and gets the IP address of `192.168.56.20`. Temporarily bring up the interface like this:

    sudo ifconfig eth1 192.168.56.20 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

Open up the `/etc/network/interfaces` file:

	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

And add—or adjust—the interface details like this:

	# The local hostmachine access interface.
	auto eth1
	iface eth1 inet static
	address 192.168.56.20
	netmask 255.255.255.0

#### Start the VirtualBox virtual machine as a headless machine.

    nohup VBoxHeadless --startvm "Ubuntu 14.04" &

Slight variant of the command without a `nohup.out` file being created:

    nohup VBoxHeadless --startvm "Ubuntu 14.04" >/dev/null 2>&1 &

#### Setup a user named `vagrant`.

Use the password `vagrant`:

    sudo adduser vagrant

Add the `vagrant` user to the `sudo` group:

    sudo adduser vagrant sudo

#### Enable `sudo` without a password for the `vagrant` user.

	sudo mkdir -p /home/vagrant/.ssh/

Now create a `authorized_keys` file:

   sudo nano /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

And add this Vagrant insecure public key to the authorized keys:

	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA6NF8iallvQVp22WDkTkyrtvp9eWW6A8YVr+kz4TjGYe7gHzIw+niNltGEFHzD8+v1I2YJ6oXevct1YeS0o9HZyN1Q9qgCgzUFtdOKLv6IedplqoPkcmF0aYet2PkEDo3MlTBckFXPITAMzF8dJSIFo9D8HfdOV0IAdx4O7PtixWKn5y2hMNG0zQPyUecp4pzC6kivAIhyfHilFR61RGL+GPXQ2MWZWFYbAGjyiYJnAmCP3NOTd0jMZEnDkbUvxhMmBYSdETk1rRgm+R4LOzFUGaHqHDLKLX+FIPKcF96hrucXzcWyLbIbEgE98OHlnVYCzRdK8jlqm8tehUc9c9WhQ== vagrant insecure public key

And now set the proper permissions for the `.ssh/` directory and the `authorized_keys` file:

    sudo chmod 700 /home/vagrant/.ssh
    sudo chmod 600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

#### Creating the actual Vagrant box.

With that done, let’s create a Vagrant package. Check your existing boxes like this:

	vagrant box list

Output should be something like this:

	There are no installed boxes! Use `vagrant box add` to add some.

So to do that, let’s export the `Ubuntu 14.04` template we just setup like this:

	vagrant package --base 'Ubuntu 14.04' --output Ubuntu_14.04_template

The output should be something like this:

	==> Ubuntu 14.04: Exporting VM...
	==> Ubuntu 14.04: Compressing package to: /Users/jack/Ubuntu_14.04_template

Once that’s done, let’s add the exported template to the list of available Vagrant packages like this:

    vagrant box add Ubuntu_14.04_template --name 'Ubuntu 14.04'

The output should be something like this:

	==> box: Box file was not detected as metadata. Adding it directly...
	==> box: Adding box 'Ubuntu 14.04' (v0) for provider:
	    box: Unpacking necessary files from: file:///Users/jack/Ubuntu_14.04_template
	==> box: Successfully added box 'Ubuntu 14.04' (v0) for 'virtualbox'!

With that done, run the Vagrant box list command again like this:

    vagrant box list

And the output should be something like this:

	Ubuntu 14.04 (virtualbox, 0)
