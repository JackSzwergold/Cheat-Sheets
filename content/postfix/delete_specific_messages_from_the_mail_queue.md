### A nice Perl script  to flush the mail queue. 

A nice Perl script that deletes messages from the mail queue that matches a regular expression passed to the script as the first argument.

To create the script open up a text file named `postfix-delete.pl`:

    nano postfix-delete.pl

And copy the script into that file:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
     
    $REGEXP = shift || die "no email-address given (regexp-style, e.g. bl.*\@example.com)!";
     
    @data = qx</usr/sbin/postqueue -p>;
    for (@data) {
      if (/^(\w+)(\*|\!)?\s/) {
         $queue_id = $1;
      }
      if($queue_id) {
        if (/$REGEXP/i) {
          $Q{$queue_id} = 1;
          $queue_id = "";
        }
      }
    }
     
    #open(POSTSUPER,"|cat") || die "couldn't open postsuper" ;
    open(POSTSUPER,"|postsuper -d -") || die "couldn't open postsuper" ;
     
    foreach (keys %Q) {
      print POSTSUPER "$_\n";
    };
    close(POSTSUPER);

Now save the file and set the permissions to something readable and executable by you like this:

    chmod 700 postfix-delete.pl

### Some usage examples of the `postfix-delete.pl` script.

For example, to delete all queued messages from or to the domain `example.com`, enter:

    ./postfix-delete.pl example.com

And to delete all queued messages that contain the characters `xyz` in the email address:

    ./postfix-delete.pl xyz
