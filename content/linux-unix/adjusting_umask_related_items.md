### Adjusting UMASK items on a CentOS/RedHat system.

Open up `/etc/bashrc`:

    sudo nano /etc/bashrc

Search through the code and find the chunk of code that looks something like this:

    # By default, we want this to get set.
    # Even for non-interactive, non-login shells.
    if [ $UID -gt 99 ] && [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
            umask 002
    else
            umask 022
    fi

Change the `umask` value in the `else` logic to:

    umask 002

### Adjusting UMASK items on an Ubuntu/Debian system.

Open up `/etc/profile`:

    sudo nano /etc/profile

The last line of the file should have a `umask` entry that reads as follows:

    umask 022

Change the `umask` value to:

    umask 002

If that line is not in the file, just add it to the file and save it.

### Adjustments to the `pam.d` UMASK settings on an Ubuntu/Debian system.

Open up `/etc/pam.d/common-session`:

    sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session

Find the line that reads something like this:

    session optional                        pam_umask.so

Change it to this by adding `umask=0002` to the end of the line:

    session optional                        pam_umask.so    umask=0002
