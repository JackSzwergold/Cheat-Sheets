Here is a collection of cheat sheets I’ve compiled for my own personal reference—and to share with clients as well as other techs—over the years. If you stumble across this and find it useful I’m cool with that.

These are mainly intended for quick reference without too much deep explanation behind what is happening.

**Caveat Emptor**: But please keep in mind that many of the instructions and ideas here might be out of date or no longer work. So if you choose to follow them, and something doesn’t work as expected? What can I tell you.
