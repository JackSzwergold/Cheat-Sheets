## Networking Netmasks and Slash Notation

By Jack Szwergold

### What’s a netmask?

On a most basic level, a netmask is a 32-bit “mask” that is used to divide IP addresses into subnets for management, isolation and security reasons.

For example, let’s pretend we are creating a simple IP address range. It would be all addresses from `192.168.56.1` to `192.168.56.254`. The netmask for that range would be `255.255.255.0` and that’s that.

But not so fast: Not all pieces of software, devices or items would be able to use a netmask assignment format like `255.255.255.0`. Those items would need to have a “slash” notation set for the combined netmask and range.

### What’s slash notation?

#### Slash notation basics.

So using this example case, instead of `192.168.56.1` with a netmask of `255.255.255.0`, the slash notation would be `192.168.56.1/24`. That `/24` is derived from the idea that:

- An IP address has four segments.
- Each `255` equates to `11111111` bits.
- Those `11111111` bits are cumulatively considered an octet which is 8 bits.
- So three of those `255`’s are multiplied to become… `24`!

In general, when most average users use a netmask—or slash notation—it’s in terms of basic octet concepts such as:

- `255.255.255.0` = `/24`
- `255.255.0.0` = `/16`
- `255.0.0.0` = `/8`

But in some cases, slash notation can become quite intricate and complex.

#### Advanced slash notation.

For example, let’s say you are creating a subnet in which—at a maximum—16 devices can connect at any given time. The netmask and slash notation for that subnet would be:

- `255.255.255.240` = `/28`

I won’t even attempt to do the math that would correlate where that `.240` octet or the `/28` comes from. But the chart below is a good reference if you have to ever do some basic network infrastructure work and need a nice netmask/slash notation to get the job done.
